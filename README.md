# 19-PWA-text-editor

This application is a text editor that runs in the browser. It is a single-page application that meets PWA criteria, meaning the app will remain fully functional even without internet connection through the use of service worker and cache APIs. The data will still be visible to the user when the app is offline. You can download the app by clicking on the install-button.

The app was build on already existing starter code - various configurations were applied to add the PWA functionality.
